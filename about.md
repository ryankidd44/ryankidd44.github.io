I am the Technical Director of the [ML Alignment Theory Scholars Program](https://www.serimats.org/) at the [Stanford Existential Risks Initiative](https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/stanford-existential-risks-initiative/content/stanford-existential-risks-initiative). Previously, I completed a PhD in physics at the University of Queensland, researching [quantum chaos in ultracold atomic systems](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=krfonA0AAAAJ&hl=en). I have a deep interest in [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/), a movement for solving the world's most impactful, neglected and tractable problems.
