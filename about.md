I am Co-Executive Director of [MATS Research](https://matsprogram.org) and Co-Founder of the [London Initiative for Safe AI](https://safeai.org.uk). Previously, I completed a PhD in physics at the University of Queensland, researching [quantum chaos in ultracold atomic systems](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=krfonA0AAAAJ&hl=en). I have a deep interest in [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/), a movement for solving the world's most impactful, neglected and tractable problems.
