Lately, I've increasingly been feeling that the universe is trying to forge me for some grand purpose. I don't ascribe actual agency to the universe and I'm aware of my probable insignificance, but oh boy has it been intense!

Some caveats: I don't think taking Dennett's intentional stance to the universe is useful; it's purely poetic license. Also, I don't get to see the counterfactual worlds where I was subjected to vastly *more* stressors and felt even more "shaped by external forces." I also think it's extremely easy to fall into an anthropocentric or solipsistic state, where one falsely attributes cause or intentionality to random natural processes; that's not what I'm doing here. Rather, given that I subscribe to a belief that the capacity to handle hard tasks ought to come with substantial responsibility, if my capacity is increasing and proving strong, this is evidence that I will feel compelled to handle even harder problems in future. Then, naturally, I consider "what are such problems?" It seems like there are many upcoming intense problems to solve. Thus, my current feeling re. work is evidence I will "be called upon by myself" to solve even harder problems soon.
