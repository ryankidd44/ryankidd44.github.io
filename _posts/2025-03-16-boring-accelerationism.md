If e/acc's/Landians are all about accelerating natural tendencies, do they aim to build black holes or aid vacuum collapse? Their mission literally seems to be, "let's make maximally uninteresting things happen faster." I much prefer "process-based" over "outcome-based" meta-ethics for this reason.

The end state of the universe is static and boring; instead, let's optimize the integral over time of interestingness! Sometimes, this means slowing down! Algal blooms are very fast, but burn through a lake's ecosystem, leaving it pretty boring. Cancer is very effective, but living humans are way more interesting.

Speed-running superintelligent AI could be pretty costly to total interestingness if we accidentally build "civilization cancer"! In the long run, slowing down a bit can often be higher value.
