Income seems to follow a [lognormal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoelastic_utility) within an appropriately defined population (apart for very high earners, who follow a Pareto distribution). Utility (and happiness) are arguably logarithmic in wealth. Ergo, happiness (due to wealth) is [normally distributed](https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/5d997e38-4e9c-42bf-11d4-dc4058d1ce00/w=3000) within a given population! I can't be the first person to have realized this.

Note that this implies nothing about how income or happiness *should* be distributed. Also, there are clearly other factors contributing to happiness, but I found this relation interesting.
