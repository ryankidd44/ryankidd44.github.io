If AI automates labor, but doesn't own capital, this would presumably create a massive surplus for humans and everyone's lives could improve (assume adequate redistribution for the sake of argument). If AI has rights and owns capital, this might not result in a surplus for humans! In fact, Malthusian dynamics might reduce human quality of life as AI populations boom, particularly if AIs are much better workers and experience higher utility gains per marginal dollar (e.g., via arbitrarily small mind enhancements with high returns to cognitive output or valenced experience).
