It is a bizarre fact about the world that it seems generally easier to improve the world via service than increasing one's earning-to-give potential for small money/impact quantities, but this inverts for higher money/impact. I.e., many people find it very hard to increase their earning potential, but there are tons of ways they can donate their time to soup kitchens, homeless shelters, Scout groups, etc. However, for high earners, it seems generally harder to find ways to donate their time that are higher impact than just trying to earn more and donate the excess (e.g., to fund soup kitchens or antimalarial bednets). An exception to the latter might be AI alignment or biosec work, but these often require specialized skills that not all high earners possess.
