Assets/services I expect to be valuable during the AI era:
- Definitely: AI, datacenters, chips, energy, land, utilities;
- Probably: complementary (e.g., data labelling, AI oversight, robotics) or human-centric (e.g., lawyers doctors, teachers) labor;
- Maybe: cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, proof-of-stake, proof-of-identity, VR.

Last one is "maybe" because I expect the actually useful solutions to AGI x society needs to be really hard to pick ex ante. Like, just because proof-of-stake smart contracts will become necessary doesn't mean our current solutions or start-ups are remotely close to the solutions that fully automated startups will generate. There seems to be little alpha to working on crypto now; it's basically blue sky research and playing roulette. Not investment advice.
