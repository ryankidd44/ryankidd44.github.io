Recently, I had the uncomfortable realization that I was working unsustainably hard and neglecting other aspects of my life. "Will to purpose" is a powerful force!

My pattern of always being in work-mode was hard to shift. It helped me to manually "unclench" and return to the present moment whenever I noticed my thoughts turning to work outside of the allotted containers (e.g., 9-6).

A good test of whether I'm appropriately detaching from work is "free association": when I let my mind wander, do the topics it lands on usually relate to work?
