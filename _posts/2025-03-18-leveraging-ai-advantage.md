I expect that soon the "ability to leverage AI" will become a massive selective advantage for knowledge work. Consequences:

- Younger workers will generally find it easier to adapt and many older workers might be left behind.
- Early adopter companies will outcompete others, with the potential for significant disruption by small, fast startups.
- Countries with stronger AI infrastructure or less red-tape will dominate global knowledge work and have more memetic influence.
