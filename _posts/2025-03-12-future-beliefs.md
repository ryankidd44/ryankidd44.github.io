Some fundamental beliefs I have about the future:
- Superintelligent AI is possible and probably coming in my lifetime.
- Superintelligent AI would transform the world more than the invention of farming, industrial revolution, nuclear age, and internet combined.
- The world could become much better or much worse. The space of possible futures is vast and morally undetermined.

What a time to be alive!
