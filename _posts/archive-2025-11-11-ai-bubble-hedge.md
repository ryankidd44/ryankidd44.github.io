I'm far from the first to say this, but there is a compelling reason to invest in AI even if you think it's probably a bubble. If AI is not a bubble, most knowledge work might be automated within a few years (and more besides); in this case, AI investments are a valuable hedge against losing your job to AI! If AI is a bubble, these investments are not as good, but your job is preserved! Not investment advice.

Casual investors are often worried about the downside risk of investing in securities that depreciate in value. There is also risk in not investing in securities that might soar in value! Picking these opportunities ex ante is obviously hard and this could be taken as an argument for investing in *any* plausibly undervalued asset. However, I don't think it's plausible for practically any other technology to have the insane economic upside potential of AGI (maybe advanced nanotech?) and I personally don't want to miss out on this. Note that in the event of an AI bubble crash and AI winter, totally different companies might be at the fore of AI! So it still pays to take a portfolio approach.
