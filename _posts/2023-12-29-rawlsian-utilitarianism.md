Does anyone else find it interesting how Rawlsianism differs from maximin preference utilitarianism because the person behind the veil of ignorance might have nonzero risk tolerance? A maximally risk averse Rawlsian would hate Omelas, but a risk-tolerant Rawlsian might accept a nonzero chance of becoming the suffering child for a much higher expected utility.
