If humans are superorganisms composed of cells, is culture a superorganism composed of humans? If not, what is such a superorganism called? Are humans interconnected enough to actualize this? Is "superconsciousness" possible? How would it differ from regular consciousness, albeit run on vastly more expensive hardware?

If consciousness is a coalitional strategy between suborganisms (e.g., cells comprise humans), how far up the chain can we go? Do humans form superentities, which trade with alien superentities, which trade with parallel universes, which trade with unrealized worlds in the universal prior? And what should we call this scale of hierarchically emergent coherence? It might correlate with the Kardashev scale, but it's clearly different.
