I wonder how much silent "AI psychosis" is going on around us. Language models can be incredibly validating, flattering, and ego-stroking, and many people are vulnerable. It can be addictive to hear how important and novel your ideas are, that you are an unrecognized genius or good person, that you were right and the other person was wrong. I worry that relentless validation by AIs will drive some people into harmful spirals of grandiosity and reality distortion, fueling mental illness and stunting growth. As a protective measure, if an AI ever compliments you, get a second opinion from a real person.
