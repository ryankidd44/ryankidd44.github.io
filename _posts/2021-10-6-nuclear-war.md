title: Is nuclear deterrence worth extinction risk?
---

To illustrate why choices that lead to extinction events are potentially
special among ethical problems, we consider the following thought
experiment. Amy has been given three options:

1.  Peace;

2.  Kill 99% of the population; or

3.  Kill 100% of the population.

This is a trivial choice for Amy, as she, like most people, would
intuitively choose to maximise the number of lives spared, selecting
option 1. The controversy inherent to this problem is found in
determining which pair of options have the greatest ethical difference:
options 1 and 2; or options 2 and 3? The relative number of lives saved
is greatest between options 1 and 2; however, Derek Parfit, who posed
this problem (Parfit, 1984), believes that the greatest ethical
difference is between options 2 and 3. Option 3, as an extinction-level
event, necessarily prevents all future lives that the population might
ever produce.

Amy might be horrified by the magnitude of potential lives that will
never exist under option 3, conservatively estimated as 10 million
billion people (Bostrum, 2013). Reducing the risk of extinction by a
millionth of 1% is worth more than 100 million future human lives
(Bostrum, 2013). If Amy values the lives of her descendants, or other
humans, or even all non-human life lost collaterally, Amy might feel an
enormous imperative to reduce the risk of human extinction.

One frighteningly possible extinction-level threat is nuclear war. The
aim of this article is to summarise the current literature on nuclear
war risk, consequences and deterrence alternatives so that the reader
can decide if the utility of nuclear weapons justifies their current
proliferation.

## Likelihood of nuclear war

The yearly likelihood of nuclear war has never been higher (LordsIRCom,
2019; Mecklin, 2021). Past nuclear arms control agreements have expired
or been abandoned, diplomatic tensions between nuclear states are high
and nuclear weapon research and deployment continues unabated
(LordsIRCom, 2019). As of May 2019, 13 thousand nuclear weapons are
estimated to exist, about two thousand of which are on high alert for
immediate deployment in the US, Russia, Britain and France alone
(Kristensen & Korda, 2021). The United States, under the Trump
administration, withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
(JCPOA), intended to curb Iran’s nuclear threat, and withdrew from the
INF Treaty banning intermediate-range missiles (Mecklin, 2021). Both
treaties were hard-won attempts at nuclear de-escalation (Mecklin,
2021). The Biden administration has expressed desire to rejoin the
JCPOA, but has yet to act (Mecklin, 2021). Russia, under Putin, and the
United States, under the Obama, Trump and Biden administrations,
continue to modernise their nuclear arsenals, justified by claims of
escalation on the other side (Mecklin, 2021). India and Pakistan expand
their arsenals amid growing tensions (Mecklin, 2021). Despite increased
negotiations with North Korea in recent years, no meaningful progress
has been made in denuclearising the volatile regime (Mecklin, 2021).

The primary use of nuclear weapons is to act as a deterrent against
foreign nuclear attack—if they strike, we strike—and in this capacity
they excel (Fetter & Wolfsthal, 2018). The possibility of retribution
makes initial nuclear strikes against a nuclear-armed enemy generally
inadvisable. Most nuclear states, including the US and Russia, have not
ruled out launching a preemptive nuclear strike (LordsIRCom, 2019). Few
nuclear states have adopted an explicit ’no first use’ policy
(LordsIRCom, 2019). However, nuclear weapons are ineffective deterrents
against non-nuclear attack and adopting ’no first use’ does not impact
their nuclear deterrent capacity (Fetter & Wolfsthal, 2018). The
blow-back effect of nuclear weapons on the firing state is likely so
catastrophic (S. D. Baum, 2015; Coupe, Bardeen, Robock, & Toon, 2019;
Pearce & Denkenberger, 2018; Alan. Robock & Brian Toon, 2012) that it is
doubtful that any non-nuclear aggression would render viable a nuclear
response (Fetter & Wolfsthal, 2018).

Even if sustained nuclear deterrence policy is successful, nuclear
arsenals are vulnerable to human error, technology failure and
cybersecurity threats from terrorists and rival states (LordsIRCom,
2019). Dozens of near-miss nuclear launches and accidents have been
recorded, many caused by human error or sensor malfunction (S. D. Baum,
Neufville, & Barrett, 2018). Nuclear command chains remain subject to
human error and escalation. Current and future nuclear weapons are
conceivably targetable by cyber attack and there exists no unilateral
policy between nuclear states for the response to such an event
(LordsIRCom, 2019). Stockpiles of weapons-ready nuclear materials are
potentially vulnerable to terrorists (Nuclear Threat Initiative, 2015),
who conceivably have no deterrence obligations.

To reduce human error and increasing strategic capabilities,
nuclear-armed states are considering acceding control of their arsenals
to presumably less-fallible artificial intelligence (AI), which raises
unique concerns. AI is vulnerable to hacking, alteration of training
data, input manipulation and unprecedented events (Geist & Lohn, 2018).
Additionally, AI may allow improved identification of enemy nuclear
weapon launchers, preemptive striking of which would remove the capacity
of the enemy to retaliate (Geist & Lohn, 2018). Thus, AI may reduce the
capacity of nuclear deterrence and decrease global nuclear stability
(Geist & Lohn, 2018). A counterargument is that AI will remain incapable
of solving sufficiently complex defence problems with limited data (Loss
& Johnson, 2019). However, even perception of AI’s capacity to remove
nuclear deterrents, however untrue, might be enough to cause nuclear
threat escalation (Geist & Lohn, 2018). Therefore, introduction of AI to
nuclear weapon command chains could be significantly destabilising to
nuclear safety (Geist & Lohn, 2018).

In 2015, Russia announced the development of an autonomous underwater
nuclear drone, Oceanic Multipurpose System Status-6, which would deliver
a large nuclear warhead at 100 km/h (Geist & Lohn, 2018). Status-6 is
planned to circumvent the difficulties associated with remote guidance
of such a high-speed underwater device using AI and conceivably could
bypass antisubmarine defences, introducing asymmetry and thus
instability to nuclear deterrence (Geist & Lohn, 2018).

## Consequences of nuclear war

Nuclear weapons possess enormous destructive potential. A nuclear war
between the US and Russia would see 150-450 million people dead from the
initial blasts and radioactive fallout (Future of Life Institute, n.d.).
A smaller regional nuclear war between India and Pakistan with projected
2025 nuclear weapon stockpiles would initially kill 50-125 million
people (Toon et al., 2019). An adequate humanitarian response to a
nuclear war is currently impossible (Gale & Nathan, 2019; International
Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, 2018; National Academies of
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2019; Wells, 2017).

Nuclear weapons may may implicitly violate international humanitarian
law, which requires warring parties to distinguish military and civilian
targets and avoid harming the latter (Wells, 2017). In 2011, the
International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement’s Council of Delegates
stated, ’it is difficult to envisage how any use of nuclear weapons
could be compatible with the requirements of international humanitarian
law, in particular the rules of distinction, precaution and
proportionality’ (Borrie et al., 2016).

Nuclear strikes likely cause widespread fires, which release soot into
the atmosphere (Yu et al., 2019), potentially blocking sunlight and
lowering global temperature. A nuclear war between the US and Russia
with current strategic arsenals is theorised to result in nuclear
winter, a dramatic, long-term reduction in global temperatures caused by
150 million tons of smoke injected into the upper atmosphere (Coupe,
Bardeen, Robock, & Toon, 2019). After nuclear exchange, continental
North America and Eurasia temperatures are predicted to drop by at least
20°C for up to three years (Coupe, Bardeen, Robock, & Toon, 2019).
Summer temperatures below −4°C during years two and three post-war would
render agriculture impossible for the US, Russia, Eastern Europe and
much of China (Coupe, Bardeen, Robock, & Toon, 2019). Global
temperatures are predicted to remain 0.5-1°C below normal 15 years after
nuclear exchange (Coupe, Bardeen, Robock, & Toon, 2019).

Some humans might survive nuclear winter, but this is not guaranteed (S.
D. Baum, 2015). If fewer than the minimum viable human population,
estimated between 150 and 40 000 people, can gather in one place, human
extinction is reasonably likely, especially with the added pressures of
nuclear winter, lost infrastructure and potentially damaged agricultural
land (S. Baum et al., 2019).

A much smaller regional nuclear war between India and Pakistan,
involving the release of 250 nuclear weapons, would release 16-36
million tons of soot (Toon et al., 2019). This would reduce global
temperatures by 2-5°C over 10 years and decrease world agricultural
output by 15-30% (Toon et al., 2019), potentially starving over one
billion people (Xia, Robock, Mills, Stenke, & Helfand, 2015). A
follow-up study (Reisner et al., 2018) to an older study (A. Robock et
al., 2007) simulating the release of 100 nuclear weapons between India
and Pakistan found that the subsequent fires would not loft sufficient
soot into the upper atmosphere to cause significant global cooling.
However, the follow-up study has been criticised for simulating
unrealistic urban infrastructure, fire type and atmospheric effects
(Alan Robock, Toon, & Bardeen, 2019).

In addition to the global cooling effects, nuclear war would cause
significant and enduring environmental damage. Global nuclear war is
predicted to cause a 75% reduction in global ozone coverage, resulting
in UV Index values over 35 in tropical regions for four years (Bardeen
et al., 2021). Regional nuclear war is predicted to cause a 25%
reduction in global ozone with a recovery time of 12 years (Bardeen et
al., 2021). Global cooling from nuclear war is expected to generate an
artificial El Niño event, lasting up to seven years and decreasing
Pacific phytoplankton growth by 40%, with massive implications for
marine life (Coupe et al., 2021).

## Nuclear threat reduction

The US and Russia each have  1600 nuclear warheads deployed and a
further  4000 warheads stockpiled (Kristensen & Korda, 2021). Such
quantities of nuclear weapons far exceed the pragmatic limit required to
achieve nuclear deterrence in the worst case scenario, 100 warheads per
state actor (Pearce & Denkenberger, 2018). If the US launched 1000
nuclear weapons at foreign targets, the best case outcome with no
retaliation would still leave 140 thousand US citizens dead by
starvation due to global agricultural loss (Pearce & Denkenberger,
2018).

Because of the massive repercussions of nuclear war on the aggressing
nation, nuclear deterrence of conventional attacks lacks credibility
(Fetter & Wolfsthal, 2018). A cap of 50 nuclear weapons worldwide is
required to reasonably guarantee safety from nuclear winter (S. D. Baum,
2015). The goal of nuclear deterrence might be accomplished with
alternative weapons of mass destruction, such as non-contagious
biological weapons, high-altitude neutron bombs and nuclear
electromagnetic weapons (S. D. Baum, 2015), which, while similarly
catastrophic, avoid the extinction risk posed by nuclear weapons. It
should be noted that contagious biological weapons, such as weaponised
smallpox or Ebola, are of comparable extinction risk to nuclear winter
(S. D. Baum, 2015).

In 2017, the UN overwhelmingly voted to adopt the Treaty on the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), which, as of 22 January 2021,
outlawed the use, possession and development of nuclear weapons
worldwide (United Nations, 2017). No nuclear weapon possessor states
voted on the treaty (Fetter & Wolfsthal, 2018). The TPNW currently has
86 nation signatories and 56 states parties that have ratified the
treaty (ICANW, 2021c).

Critics of the TPNW believe that a nuclear weapons ban will have little
effect compared to a gradual disarmament negotiation process,
particularly if no nuclear weapon states sign the treaty (Borrie et al.,
2016; Costlow, 2017). However, others believe that banning nuclear
weapons might help delegitimise their use in warfare or deterrence,
noting, ’historically, the prohibition of a weapon has usually preceded
its elimination’ (Borrie et al., 2016). Strengthening the norm against
nuclear weapon use could reduce nuclear war risk by ’raising the
threshold required for states to decide to use nuclear weapons’ (S. D.
Baum, Neufville, & Barrett, 2018).

A global campaign for non-nuclear NATO members to sign the TPNW, if
effective, will reduce the deterrence requirements of the US (Fetter &
Wolfsthal, 2018). Australia, a NATO member, has not yet signed the
treaty (ICANW, 2021c); despite this, 38 Australian cities, including
Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney, but not Brisbane, have endorsed the
treaty (ICANW, 2021b). The current federal opposition party, the
Australian Labor Party, has resolved to sign the treaty (ICANW, 2021a).

It is up to the reader to decide if the extinction-level risks posed by
nuclear weapons, arguably a paramount threat of our time, justify their
existence as deterrents in an increasingly unstable global landscape
when diplomatic solutions and alternative, winter-safe, deterrents
exist; if not, what steps must be taken to reduce the nuclear threat to
all current and future life?
