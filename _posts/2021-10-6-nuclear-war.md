# Ethics of extinction

To illustrate why choices that lead to extinction events are potentially
special among ethical problems, we consider the following thought
experiment. Amy has been given three options:

1.  Peace;

2.  Kill 99% of the population; or

3.  Kill 100% of the population.

This is a trivial choice for Amy, as she, like most people, would
intuitively choose to maximise the number of lives spared, selecting
option 1. The controversy inherent to this problem is found in
determining which pair of options have the greatest ethical difference:
options 1 and 2; or options 2 and 3? The relative number of lives saved
is greatest between options 1 and 2; however, Derek Parfit, who posed
this problem [@Parfit1984], believes that the greatest ethical
difference is between options 2 and 3. Option 3, as an extinction-level
event, necessarily prevents all future lives that the population might
ever produce.

Amy might be horrified by the magnitude of potential lives that will
never exist under option 3, conservatively estimated as 10 million
billion people [@Bostrum2013]. Reducing the risk of extinction by a
millionth of 1% is worth more than 100 million future human lives
[@Bostrum2013]. If Amy values the lives of her descendants, or other
humans, or even all non-human life lost collaterally, Amy might feel an
enormous imperative to reduce the risk of human extinction.

One frighteningly possible extinction-level threat is nuclear war. The
aim of this article is to summarise the current literature on nuclear
war risk, consequences and deterrence alternatives so that the reader
can decide if the utility of nuclear weapons justifies their current
proliferation.

# Likelihood of nuclear war

The yearly likelihood of nuclear war has never been higher
[@Mecklin2021; @HouseOfLords2019]. Past nuclear arms control agreements
have expired or been abandoned, diplomatic tensions between nuclear
states are high and nuclear weapon research and deployment continues
unabated [@HouseOfLords2019]. As of May 2019, 13 thousand nuclear
weapons are estimated to exist, about two thousand of which are on high
alert for immediate deployment in the US, Russia, Britain and France
alone [@Kristensen2019]. The United States, under the Trump
administration, withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
(JCPOA), intended to curb Iran's nuclear threat, and withdrew from the
INF Treaty banning intermediate-range missiles [@Mecklin2021]. Both
treaties were hard-won attempts at nuclear de-escalation [@Mecklin2021].
The Biden administration has expressed desire to rejoin the JCPOA, but
has yet to act [@Mecklin2021]. Russia, under Putin, and the United
States, under the Obama, Trump and Biden administrations, continue to
modernise their nuclear arsenals, justified by claims of escalation on
the other side [@Mecklin2021]. India and Pakistan expand their arsenals
amid growing tensions [@Mecklin2021]. Despite increased negotiations
with North Korea in recent years, no meaningful progress has been made
in denuclearising the volatile regime [@Mecklin2021].

The primary use of nuclear weapons is to act as a deterrent against
foreign nuclear attack---if they strike, we strike---and in this
capacity they excel [@Fetter2018]. The possibility of retribution makes
initial nuclear strikes against a nuclear-armed enemy generally
inadvisable. Most nuclear states, including the US and Russia, have not
ruled out launching a preemptive nuclear strike [@HouseOfLords2019]. Few
nuclear states have adopted an explicit 'no first use' policy
[@HouseOfLords2019]. However, nuclear weapons are ineffective deterrents
against non-nuclear attack and adopting 'no first use' does not impact
their nuclear deterrent capacity [@Fetter2018]. The blow-back effect of
nuclear weapons on the firing state is likely so catastrophic
[@Coupe2019; @Pearce2018; @Baum2015; @Robock2012] that it is doubtful
that any non-nuclear aggression would render viable a nuclear response
[@Fetter2018].

Even if sustained nuclear deterrence policy is successful, nuclear
arsenals are vulnerable to human error, technology failure and
cybersecurity threats from terrorists and rival states
[@HouseOfLords2019]. Dozens of near-miss nuclear launches and accidents
have been recorded, many caused by human error or sensor malfunction
[@Baum2018_probability]. Nuclear command chains remain subject to human
error and escalation. Current and future nuclear weapons are conceivably
targetable by cyber attack and there exists no unilateral policy between
nuclear states for the response to such an event [@HouseOfLords2019].
Stockpiles of weapons-ready nuclear materials are potentially vulnerable
to terrorists [@NTI2015], who conceivably have no deterrence
obligations.

To reduce human error and increasing strategic capabilities,
nuclear-armed states are considering acceding control of their arsenals
to presumably less-fallible artificial intelligence (AI), which raises
unique concerns. AI is vulnerable to hacking, alteration of training
data, input manipulation and unprecedented events [@Geist2018].
Additionally, AI may allow improved identification of enemy nuclear
weapon launchers, preemptive striking of which would remove the capacity
of the enemy to retaliate [@Geist2018]. Thus, AI may reduce the capacity
of nuclear deterrence and decrease global nuclear stability
[@Geist2018]. A counterargument is that AI will remain incapable of
solving sufficiently complex defence problems with limited data
[@Loss2019]. However, even perception of AI's capacity to remove nuclear
deterrents, however untrue, might be enough to cause nuclear threat
escalation [@Geist2018]. Therefore, introduction of AI to nuclear weapon
command chains could be significantly destabilising to nuclear safety
[@Geist2018].

In 2015, Russia announced the development of an autonomous underwater
nuclear drone, Oceanic Multipurpose System Status-6, which would deliver
a large nuclear warhead at 100 km/h [@Geist2018]. Status-6 is planned to
circumvent the difficulties associated with remote guidance of such a
high-speed underwater device using AI and conceivably could bypass
antisubmarine defences, introducing asymmetry and thus instability to
nuclear deterrence [@Geist2018].

# Consequences of nuclear war

Nuclear weapons possess enormous destructive potential. A nuclear war
between the US and Russia would see 150-450 million people dead from the
initial blasts and radioactive fallout [@FLI]. A smaller regional
nuclear war between India and Pakistan with projected 2025 nuclear
weapon stockpiles would initially kill 50-125 million people
[@Toon2019]. An adequate humanitarian response to a nuclear war is
currently impossible [@RedCross2018; @Pray2019; @Gale2019; @Wells2017].

Nuclear weapons may may implicitly violate international humanitarian
law, which requires warring parties to distinguish military and civilian
targets and avoid harming the latter [@Wells2017]. In 2011, the
International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement's Council of Delegates
stated, 'it is difficult to envisage how any use of nuclear weapons
could be compatible with the requirements of international humanitarian
law, in particular the rules of distinction, precaution and
proportionality' [@Borrie2016].

Nuclear strikes likely cause widespread fires, which release soot into
the atmosphere [@Yu2019], potentially blocking sunlight and lowering
global temperature. A nuclear war between the US and Russia with current
strategic arsenals is theorised to result in nuclear winter, a dramatic,
long-term reduction in global temperatures caused by 150 million tons of
smoke injected into the upper atmosphere [@Coupe2019]. After nuclear
exchange, continental North America and Eurasia temperatures are
predicted to drop by at least 20°C for up to three years [@Coupe2019].
Summer temperatures below −4°C during years two and three post-war would
render agriculture impossible for the US, Russia, Eastern Europe and
much of China [@Coupe2019]. Global temperatures are predicted to remain
0.5-1°C below normal 15 years after nuclear exchange [@Coupe2019].

Some humans might survive nuclear winter, but this is not guaranteed
[@Baum2015]. If fewer than the minimum viable human population,
estimated between 150 and 40 000 people, can gather in one place, human
extinction is reasonably likely, especially with the added pressures of
nuclear winter, lost infrastructure and potentially damaged agricultural
land [@Baum2019].

A much smaller regional nuclear war between India and Pakistan,
involving the release of 250 nuclear weapons, would release 16-36
million tons of soot [@Toon2019]. This would reduce global temperatures
by 2-5°C over 10 years and decrease world agricultural output by 15-30%
[@Toon2019], potentially starving over one billion people [@Xia2015]. A
follow-up study [@Reisner2019] to an older study [@Robock2007_2]
simulating the release of 100 nuclear weapons between India and Pakistan
found that the subsequent fires would not loft sufficient soot into the
upper atmosphere to cause significant global cooling. However, the
follow-up study has been criticised for simulating unrealistic urban
infrastructure, fire type and atmospheric effects [@Robock2019].

In addition to the global cooling effects, nuclear war would cause
significant and enduring environmental damage. Global nuclear war is
predicted to cause a 75% reduction in global ozone coverage, resulting
in UV Index values over 35 in tropical regions for four years
[@Bardeen2021]. Regional nuclear war is predicted to cause a 25%
reduction in global ozone with a recovery time of 12 years
[@Bardeen2021]. Global cooling from nuclear war is expected to generate
an artificial El Niño event, lasting up to seven years and decreasing
Pacific phytoplankton growth by 40%, with massive implications for
marine life [@Coupe2021].

# Nuclear threat reduction

The US and Russia each have  1600 nuclear warheads deployed and a
further  4000 warheads stockpiled [@Kristensen2019]. Such quantities of
nuclear weapons far exceed the pragmatic limit required to achieve
nuclear deterrence in the worst case scenario, 100 warheads per state
actor [@Pearce2018]. If the US launched 1000 nuclear weapons at foreign
targets, the best case outcome with no retaliation would still leave 140
thousand US citizens dead by starvation due to global agricultural loss
[@Pearce2018].

Because of the massive repercussions of nuclear war on the aggressing
nation, nuclear deterrence of conventional attacks lacks credibility
[@Fetter2018]. A cap of 50 nuclear weapons worldwide is required to
reasonably guarantee safety from nuclear winter [@Baum2015]. The goal of
nuclear deterrence might be accomplished with alternative weapons of
mass destruction, such as non-contagious biological weapons,
high-altitude neutron bombs and nuclear electromagnetic weapons
[@Baum2015], which, while similarly catastrophic, avoid the extinction
risk posed by nuclear weapons. It should be noted that contagious
biological weapons, such as weaponised smallpox or Ebola, are of
comparable extinction risk to nuclear winter [@Baum2015].

In 2017, the UN overwhelmingly voted to adopt the Treaty on the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), which, as of 22 January 2021,
outlawed the use, possession and development of nuclear weapons
worldwide [@UN2017]. No nuclear weapon possessor states voted on the
treaty [@Fetter2018]. The TPNW currently has 86 nation signatories and
56 states parties that have ratified the treaty [@ICAN_nations].

Critics of the TPNW believe that a nuclear weapons ban will have little
effect compared to a gradual disarmament negotiation process,
particularly if no nuclear weapon states sign the treaty
[@Costlow2017; @Borrie2016]. However, others believe that banning
nuclear weapons might help delegitimise their use in warfare or
deterrence, noting, 'historically, the prohibition of a weapon has
usually preceded its elimination' [@Borrie2016]. Strengthening the norm
against nuclear weapon use could reduce nuclear war risk by 'raising the
threshold required for states to decide to use nuclear weapons'
[@Baum2018_probability].

A global campaign for non-nuclear NATO members to sign the TPNW, if
effective, will reduce the deterrence requirements of the US
[@Fetter2018]. Australia, a NATO member, has not yet signed the treaty
[@ICAN_nations]; despite this, 18 Australian cities, including Canberra,
Melbourne and Sydney, but not Brisbane, have endorsed the treaty
[@ICAN_cities]. The current federal opposition party, the Australian
Labor Party, has resolved to sign the treaty [@ICAN_australia].

It is up to the reader to decide if the extinction-level risks posed by
nuclear weapons, arguably a paramount threat of our time, justify their
existence as deterrents in an increasingly unstable global landscape
when diplomacy and alternative, winter-safe, deterrents exist; if not,
what steps must be taken to reduce the nuclear threat to all current and
future life?
