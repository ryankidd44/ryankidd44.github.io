title: Is nuclear deterrence worth extinction risk?
---

To illustrate why choices that lead to extinction events are potentially
special among ethical problems, we consider the following thought
experiment. Amy has been given three options:

1.  Peace;

2.  Kill 99% of the population; or

3.  Kill 100% of the population.

This is a trivial choice for Amy, as she, like most people, would
intuitively choose to maximise the number of lives spared, selecting
option 1. The controversy inherent to this problem is found in
determining which pair of options have the greatest ethical difference:
options 1 and 2; or options 2 and 3? The relative number of lives saved
is greatest between options 1 and 2; however, Derek Parfit, who posed
this problem  \[1\], believes that the greatest ethical difference is
between options 2 and 3. Option 3, as an extinction-level event,
necessarily prevents all future lives that the population might ever
produce.

Amy might be horrified by the magnitude of potential lives that will
never exist under option 3, conservatively estimated as 10 million
billion people  \[2\]. Reducing the risk of extinction by a millionth of
1% is worth more than 100 million future human lives  \[2\]. If Amy
values the lives of her descendants, or other humans, or even all
non-human life lost collaterally, Amy might feel an enormous imperative
to reduce the risk of human extinction.

One frighteningly possible extinction-level threat is nuclear war. The
aim of this article is to summarise the current literature on nuclear
war risk, consequences and deterrence alternatives so that the reader
can decide if the utility of nuclear weapons justifies their current
proliferation.

## Likelihood of nuclear war

The yearly likelihood of nuclear war has never been higher  \[3,4\].
Past nuclear arms control agreements have expired or been abandoned,
diplomatic tensions between nuclear states are high and nuclear weapon
research and deployment continues unabated  \[4\]. As of May 2019, 13
thousand nuclear weapons are estimated to exist, about two thousand of
which are on high alert for immediate deployment in the US, Russia,
Britain and France alone  \[5\]. The United States, under the Trump
administration, withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
(JCPOA), intended to curb Iran’s nuclear threat, and withdrew from the
INF Treaty banning intermediate-range missiles  \[3\]. Both treaties
were hard-won attempts at nuclear de-escalation  \[3\]. The Biden
administration has expressed desire to rejoin the JCPOA, but has yet to
act  \[3\]. Russia, under Putin, and the United States, under the Obama,
Trump and Biden administrations, continue to modernise their nuclear
arsenals, justified by claims of escalation on the other side  \[3\].
India and Pakistan expand their arsenals amid growing tensions  \[3\].
Despite increased negotiations with North Korea in recent years, no
meaningful progress has been made in denuclearising the volatile regime
 \[3\].

The primary use of nuclear weapons is to act as a deterrent against
foreign nuclear attack—if they strike, we strike—and in this capacity
they excel  \[6\]. The possibility of retribution makes initial nuclear
strikes against a nuclear-armed enemy generally inadvisable. Most
nuclear states, including the US and Russia, have not ruled out
launching a preemptive nuclear strike  \[4\]. Few nuclear states have
adopted an explicit ‘no first use’ policy  \[4\]. However, nuclear
weapons are ineffective deterrents against non-nuclear attack and
adopting ‘no first use’ does not impact their nuclear deterrent capacity
 \[6\]. The blow-back effect of nuclear weapons on the firing state is
likely so catastrophic  \[7–10\] that it is doubtful that any
non-nuclear aggression would render viable a nuclear response  \[6\].

Even if sustained nuclear deterrence policy is successful, nuclear
arsenals are vulnerable to human error, technology failure and
cybersecurity threats from terrorists and rival states  \[4\]. Dozens of
near-miss nuclear launches and accidents have been recorded, many caused
by human error or sensor malfunction  \[11\]. Nuclear command chains
remain subject to human error and escalation. Current and future nuclear
weapons are conceivably targetable by cyber attack and there exists no
unilateral policy between nuclear states for the response to such an
event  \[4\]. Stockpiles of weapons-ready nuclear materials are
potentially vulnerable to terrorists  \[12\], who conceivably have no
deterrence obligations.

To reduce human error and increasing strategic capabilities,
nuclear-armed states are considering acceding control of their arsenals
to presumably less-fallible artificial intelligence (AI), which raises
unique concerns. AI is vulnerable to hacking, alteration of training
data, input manipulation and unprecedented events  \[13\]. Additionally,
AI may allow improved identification of enemy nuclear weapon launchers,
preemptive striking of which would remove the capacity of the enemy to
retaliate  \[13\]. Thus, AI may reduce the capacity of nuclear
deterrence and decrease global nuclear stability  \[13\]. A
counterargument is that AI will remain incapable of solving sufficiently
complex defence problems with limited data  \[14\]. However, even
perception of AI’s capacity to remove nuclear deterrents, however
untrue, might be enough to cause nuclear threat escalation  \[13\].
Therefore, introduction of AI to nuclear weapon command chains could be
significantly destabilising to nuclear safety  \[13\].

In 2015, Russia announced the development of an autonomous underwater
nuclear drone, Oceanic Multipurpose System Status-6, which would deliver
a large nuclear warhead at 100 km/h  \[13\]. Status-6 is planned to
circumvent the difficulties associated with remote guidance of such a
high-speed underwater device using AI and conceivably could bypass
antisubmarine defences, introducing asymmetry and thus instability to
nuclear deterrence  \[13\].

## Consequences of nuclear war

Nuclear weapons possess enormous destructive potential. A nuclear war
between the US and Russia would see 150-450 million people dead from the
initial blasts and radioactive fallout  \[15\]. A smaller regional
nuclear war between India and Pakistan with projected 2025 nuclear
weapon stockpiles would initially kill 50-125 million people  \[16\]. An
adequate humanitarian response to a nuclear war is currently impossible
 \[17–20\].

Nuclear weapons may may implicitly violate international humanitarian
law, which requires warring parties to distinguish military and civilian
targets and avoid harming the latter  \[20\]. In 2011, the International
Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement’s Council of Delegates stated, ‘it
is difficult to envisage how any use of nuclear weapons could be
compatible with the requirements of international humanitarian law, in
particular the rules of distinction, precaution and proportionality’
 \[21\].

Nuclear strikes likely cause widespread fires, which release soot into
the atmosphere  \[22\], potentially blocking sunlight and lowering
global temperature. A nuclear war between the US and Russia with current
strategic arsenals is theorised to result in nuclear winter, a dramatic,
long-term reduction in global temperatures caused by 150 million tons of
smoke injected into the upper atmosphere  \[7\]. After nuclear exchange,
continental North America and Eurasia temperatures are predicted to drop
by at least 20°C for up to three years  \[7\]. Summer temperatures below
−4°C during years two and three post-war would render agriculture
impossible for the US, Russia, Eastern Europe and much of China  \[7\].
Global temperatures are predicted to remain 0.5-1°C below normal 15
years after nuclear exchange  \[7\].

Some humans might survive nuclear winter, but this is not guaranteed
 \[9\]. If fewer than the minimum viable human population, estimated
between 150 and 40 000 people, can gather in one place, human extinction
is reasonably likely, especially with the added pressures of nuclear
winter, lost infrastructure and potentially damaged agricultural land
 \[23\].

A much smaller regional nuclear war between India and Pakistan,
involving the release of 250 nuclear weapons, would release 16-36
million tons of soot  \[16\]. This would reduce global temperatures by
2-5°C over 10 years and decrease world agricultural output by 15-30%
 \[16\], potentially starving over one billion people  \[24\]. A
follow-up study  \[25\] to an older study  \[26\] simulating the release
of 100 nuclear weapons between India and Pakistan found that the
subsequent fires would not loft sufficient soot into the upper
atmosphere to cause significant global cooling. However, the follow-up
study has been criticised for simulating unrealistic urban
infrastructure, fire type and atmospheric effects  \[27\].

In addition to the global cooling effects, nuclear war would cause
significant and enduring environmental damage. Global nuclear war is
predicted to cause a 75% reduction in global ozone coverage, resulting
in UV Index values over 35 in tropical regions for four years  \[28\].
Regional nuclear war is predicted to cause a 25% reduction in global
ozone with a recovery time of 12 years  \[28\]. Global cooling from
nuclear war is expected to generate an artificial El Niño event, lasting
up to seven years and decreasing Pacific phytoplankton growth by 40%,
with massive implications for marine life  \[29\].

## Nuclear threat reduction

The US and Russia each have 1600 nuclear warheads deployed and a further
4000 warheads stockpiled  \[5\]. Such quantities of nuclear weapons far
exceed the pragmatic limit required to achieve nuclear deterrence in the
worst case scenario, 100 warheads per state actor  \[8\]. If the US
launched 1000 nuclear weapons at foreign targets, the best case outcome
with no retaliation would still leave 140 thousand US citizens dead by
starvation due to global agricultural loss  \[8\].

Because of the massive repercussions of nuclear war on the aggressing
nation, nuclear deterrence of conventional attacks lacks credibility
 \[6\]. A cap of 50 nuclear weapons worldwide is required to reasonably
guarantee safety from nuclear winter  \[9\]. The goal of nuclear
deterrence might be accomplished with alternative weapons of mass
destruction, such as non-contagious biological weapons, high-altitude
neutron bombs and nuclear electromagnetic weapons  \[9\], which, while
similarly catastrophic, avoid the extinction risk posed by nuclear
weapons. It should be noted that contagious biological weapons, such as
weaponised smallpox or Ebola, are of comparable extinction risk to
nuclear winter  \[9\].

In 2017, the UN overwhelmingly voted to adopt the Treaty on the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), which, as of 22 January 2021,
outlawed the use, possession and development of nuclear weapons
worldwide  \[30\]. No nuclear weapon possessor states voted on the
treaty  \[6\]. The TPNW currently has 86 nation signatories and 56
states parties that have ratified the treaty  \[31\].

Critics of the TPNW believe that a nuclear weapons ban will have little
effect compared to a gradual disarmament negotiation process,
particularly if no nuclear weapon states sign the treaty  \[21,32\].
However, others believe that banning nuclear weapons might help
delegitimise their use in warfare or deterrence, noting, ‘historically,
the prohibition of a weapon has usually preceded its elimination’
 \[21\]. Strengthening the norm against nuclear weapon use could reduce
nuclear war risk by ‘raising the threshold required for states to decide
to use nuclear weapons’  \[11\].

A global campaign for non-nuclear NATO members to sign the TPNW, if
effective, will reduce the deterrence requirements of the US  \[6\].
Australia, a NATO member, has not yet signed the treaty  \[31\]; despite
this, 38 Australian cities, including Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney,
but not Brisbane, have endorsed the treaty  \[33\]. The current federal
opposition party, the Australian Labor Party, has resolved to sign the
treaty  \[34\].

It is up to the reader to decide if the extinction-level risks posed by
nuclear weapons, arguably a paramount threat of our time, justify their
existence as deterrents in an increasingly unstable global landscape
when diplomatic solutions and alternative, winter-safe, deterrents
exist; if not, what steps must be taken to reduce the nuclear threat to
all current and future life?
