It seems plausible to me that if AGI progress becomes strongly bottlenecked on architecture design or hyperparameter search, a more "genetic algorithm"-like approach will follow. Automated AI researchers could run and evaluate many small experiments in parallel, covering a vast hyperparameter space. If small experiments are generally predictive of larger experiments (and they seem to be, a la scaling laws) and model inference costs are cheap enough, this parallelized approach might be be 1) computationally affordable and 2) successful at overcoming the architecture bottleneck.
