An Executive trusting their AI assistant over human employees is like a King trusting their Jester over Generals. Jesters can be incredibly sycophantic and flattering! Even worse, sometimes Kings believe the Jester's ideas are their own: "You're so brilliant, my liege!"

Worst is when the King becomes convinced of their brilliance and fires the Generals. None can object, as they fear their jobs and the Jester has wormed too deep. Thus the psychosis deepens.

Without empirical testing, or even checking against the minds of other humans, this AI psychosis can compound on itself. The solution? Touch reality more.
