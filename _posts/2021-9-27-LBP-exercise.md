title: Preventing low back pain with exercise

Low back pain (LBP) is an extremely common and debilitating symptom worldwide, experienced by people of all ages and socioeconomic circumstance [[1]](http://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)30480-X). In 2017, LBP contributed 65 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and was the primary cause of work absenteeism and disability worldwide [[2]](https://doi.org/10.21037/atm.2020.02.175). Most LBP cannot be attributed to a specific source and bouts, while typically short, frequently reoccur [[1]](http://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)30480-X).

Clinical practise guidelines consistently recommend against treating LBP with opioids, foot orthotics, disc replacement and spinal injections [[3]](https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2018-099878). Routine medical imaging for non-specific LBP is associated with harms [[3]](https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2018-099878). In particular, opioid use is discouraged for LBP due to the potential for opioid-related harms and the recent finding that NSAIDS are equally efficacious for treating acute LBP [[3]](https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2018-099878). Despite the consistency of these guidelines, imaging, surgery and opioids are overused in clinical practise [[3]](https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2018-099878).

The most effective preventative treatment for LBP seems to be exercise, with or without accompanying education [[4]](https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2018-100035). Exercise alone reduces the risk of LBP by 33% on average, with a 95% confidence interval of 15-47% [[5]](https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwx337). Further research into optimal frequency, intensity, type and duration of exercise for the prevention and treatment of low back pain is recommended [[4]](https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2018-100035). As a naive starting point, the *Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans* recommend that all adults perform resistance exercises of moderate or greater intensity for all major muscle groups at least twice per week, in addition to minimum aerobic activity guidelines [[6]](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2018.14854).

While no specific form of sufficiently intense full-body resistance exercise is recommended above all others, I have highly enjoyed resistance training with free weights due to the often low barrier to entry, capacity for consistent and graded progress, and wealth of associated high-quality educational resources. I highly recommend *Barbell Medicine*'s [free exercise program](https://www.barbellmedicine.com/blog/the-beginner-prescription/) and their article on [understanding and training around pain](https://www.barbellmedicine.com/blog/pain-in-training-what-do/). Individuals who are unable to perform basic barbell movements through a full range of motion can instead use light dumbbells or even decrease the range of motion if necessary.

Individuals new to resistance training might experience the following barriers:
* **Insufficient time or money to engage in gym-based activity.** Gyms typically cost $12-15/week in Australia. Resistance training in a gym should not require more than 60-90 minutes per session. *Barbell Medicine* also provide a [free at-home exercise program](https://www.barbellmedicine.com/blog/how-to-exercise-at-home/).
* **A lack of training motivation.** Self-monitoring and goal-setting behaviour, such as recording progress and setting achievable targets, can significantly improve exercise motivation [[7]](https://doi.org/0.1080/17437199.2018.1435299). Group exercise, such as with a friend or personal trainer, can also significantly improve motivation [[7]](https://doi.org/0.1080/17437199.2018.1435299).
* **Fear of injury or preoccupation with perfect form and 'mobility'.** There is no evidence that lower back flexion during resistance training is a risk factor for LBP onset or persistence [[8]](https://doi.org/10.2519/jospt.2020.9218). People with LBP tend to move with a more rigid back than those without pain [[9]](https://doi.org/10.1515/sjpain-2019-0089), potentially a learned response to a [common narrative about the dangers of spinal flexion](https://www.barbellmedicine.com/blog/pain-and-movement-caught-in-an-endless-loop-of-misinformation/). [Movement variability is safe and normal](https://www.barbellmedicine.com/blog/movement-variability-should-we-eliminate-it-or-embrace-it/), and one should [expect lower back flexion](https://www.barbellmedicine.com/blog/normal-movements-of-the-low-back-during-squats-and-deadlifts/) during resistance exercise. Improving 'mobility' [should not be prioritised](https://www.barbellmedicine.com/blog/mobility-explained/) over resistance training.
